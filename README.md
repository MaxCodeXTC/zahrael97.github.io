# Hello,
my name is __Zahra Elhamraoui__, 22 years old Moroccan girl.

I am an __optimistic__, __super curious__ and __creative person__ who is always ready to reveal challenges and learn new things.

I have always had this deep admiration for science with my high school diploma in __experimental physics__ and my bachelor's degree in __applied mathematics and computer science__ in addition to a master's degree in __bioinformatics and medical computer science__.
I believe that I have the skills required to solve problems related to our daily life.

I am currently very curious about machine learning and I have __dedicated 2020 only to learning the tools of machine learning__. In 10 years I will see myself as a successful woman in data science and machine learning, and as a full-time volunteer, __I plan to start my journey with the volunteering next year 2021__ after I graduate.

I am a __self-learning artificial intelligence__, so I work on personal projects where I aim to learn new tools like the classification of breast cancer or Survival Analysis using the basic algorithms of machine learning, one of my objectives for 2020 is to work on a high-level project using machine learning.

I believe a successful person is a __hard-working person__, and we only live once so let's try as much as we can.
